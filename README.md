# NYC-vehicle-collisions

On average, 92 people die due to vehicular accidents on a daily basis in the United States of America. Such high rates of causalities can be avoided if law enforcement agencies understand the major reasons and formulate policies to solve them. In our quest to start deliberating in this direction, we decided to look at the record of Motor Vehicle Collisions in New York City provided by the city government under the Open Data initiative. New York City as the financial capital of the world, attracts large sections of the population that call it home. We felt it would be an ideal location to conduct our analysis on. Our motivation to conduct this research was to identify trends and hotspots in motor vehicle collisions and related casualties that could potentially be used to make the city safer. Another motivation was to build a predictive model that could potentially help emergency responders predict casualties and fatalities in an accident before arriving on the scene and alignresources accordingly


# Overview of Dataset
For our research we decided to look at the records of motor vehicle collisions that happened in New York city. The data was collected from New York Police Department as part of their New York open data initiative. The dataset we chose is a record of almost a million motor collisions in New York City between July 2012 and January 2017. The dataset provided had 29 variables including timestamps, dates, locations, information about vehicles involved, reasons for accident and fatalities by categories.


# Intent of Analysis
In our initial analysis, we found that a total of 216,399 people were injured and more than 1000 killed in the collisions that happened across the city between 2013 to 2016. A report by NYC government says that being struck by a vehicle is the leading cause of injury-related death for children under 14, and the second leading cause for seniors. So, the idea behind analyzing this dataset is to identify trends and patterns in the collisions that can be used by law enforcement and/or city planning commission to reduce risk to human lives.

In order to do so, we developed a few research questions that will help us analyze the dataset and come up with some insights.

1) Which part of the city has the most number of accidents injuring pedestrians?
2) What were the most common reasons for accidents causing injuries?
3) What time of the day has the most number of accidents?
4) What time of day has the highest chance of being in an accident causing injury?
5) Is there a rising or declining trend in the number of fatalities over the years?
